          to memorialize Contractor Services agreed by the Contractor and the Client such as timelines, deliverables,

        <p><strong>2.5 Contractors appointment of RemotePort as payment agent.  </strong>By these Terms, Contractors
          hereby appoints RemotePort as its or their limited authorized payment collection agent (“<strong>Payment
            Agent</strong>”) solely for the purpose of facilitating the receipt of payments and Fees from Clients for
          Contractor Services and authorizes RemotePass, in its role as Payment Agent to (a) hold, disburse and retain
          payments on behalf of Contractors pursuant to these Terms, or otherwise instruct RemotePass’ Payment Services
          Providers to do so, (ii) issue refunds to Clients at the request of Contractors; and (iii) manage Client
          credit and debit card chargebacks on behalf of Contractors. Such payments will be made through Payment
          Services Providers, when applicable, and in accordance with the rules, contract and policies that govern such
          Payment Service Providers. In accepting appointment as Payment Agent, RemotePort assumes no liability
          whatsoever for any acts or omissions of Contractors related to any Contractor Agreement or these Terms of
          Service, failure by Contractors to provide the Services in accordance with any Contractor Agreement, or
          failure by Clients to pay Fees or make payments owed to Contractors, and Contractors understand that
          RemotePass’ obligation to pay Contractors is subject to and conditional upon RemotePass’ actual receipt of
          payment from Clients. Clients’ payment obligations to Contractors will be satisfied upon receipt of payment by
          RemotePort (or its Payment Services Provider, as applicable), and RemotePort (via its Payment Services
          Provider, as applicable) will be responsible for remitting funds to Contractors in the manner described in
          these Terms of Service. In the event that RemotePort (via Payment Services Provider) does not remit any such
          amounts to a Contractor, the Contractor will have recourse for non-payment solely against RemotePass, and not
          Clients. </p>
        <p><strong>2.6 Payments to and from RemotePort Accounts</strong>. Other than RemotePass’ role as a limited
          payment agent for Contractors, RemotePort does not and will not provide banking, deposit taking, stored value,
          e-money, escrow, insurance or any other financial service to Users, and, for the avoidance of doubt,
          RemotePort is not a bank, deposit taking institution, money transmitter or provider of stored value or
          e-money, holder of escrowed funds, insurance company or any other sort of financial services company. To
          facilitate payments on behalf ofContractors, RemotePort partners with Payment Service Providers. We have
          provided more information about the types of payments that RemotePort accept via such Payment Service
          Providers on our payment methods page, including what Payment methods are accepted in various geographic
          locations and other limitations. It is important for all Users to review this page before using the Services
          to understand how and whether they can pay or receiveFees.  Users non-termination or continued use of
          RemotePort reaffirms that it is authorized to use the Users’ payment methods on file for the Services. This
          right does not waive RemotePass’ right to seek payment directly from the User.</p>
        <p><strong>2.7 User Relationship with Payment ServiceProviders.</strong> By making use of the Services, User
          agrees to be bound by applicable Payment Service Providers agreements, terms and conditions and other
          policies, and hereby consents and authorizes RemotePort to delegate any authorizations and any share
          information that the User provides to RemotePort with any third-party service provider, including Payment
          Service Providers to the extent required to provide a relevant payment method. In addition, certain Payment
          Service Providers may require you to accept such providers’ own terms and conditions and privacy policies
          independently of these Terms.  RemotePort is not and will not be liable to you for any losses you suffer in
          connection with your use of any third-party Payment Service Providers. In addition, different payment methods
          are subject to different sets of rules – for example, debit and credit cards are subject to network rules and
          the terms of conditions of cards issuers, acquires and processors – and different payment methods may be
          subject to additional fees, such as foreign exchange fees or other fees imposed separately by a Payment
          Service Provider, a payment network or by a Users’ own financial institution.</p>
        <p><strong>2.8 Reversals and payment disputes</strong>.  Except to satisfy Payment Service Provider obligations
          or other compliance obligations, RemotePort cannot reverse payments or withhold funds paid to Contractors and
          cannot cause the third-party financial service providers with respect to payment of funds from Clients and
          settlement of funds to Contractors to reverse or withhold payments. If a Client is not satisfied with the
          service provided by a Contractor or makes a payment in error, the Client must initiate a refund, reversal or
          other payment dispute process directly with the Contractor or with the relevant Payment Service Provider.
          RemotePort will not adjudicate payment, Contractor Agreement or other disputes between Users regardless of
          payment method. </p>

          RemotePort Account and bar access to the Site or the Service. If you wish to terminate your account, please
          contact us at <a href="mailto:support@remoteport.com">support@remoteport.com</a>. You may delete Contractor
          Agreements at any time from within the RemotePort Site, and the deleted Contractor Agreement and all of the
          information associated with the Contractor Agreement will immediately become inaccessible to other Users,
          after which we will permanently delete the Contractor Agreement from our Site. All provisions of the Terms
          which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation,
          Section 5 [Intellectual Property], Section 9 [Interruption ofService, force majeure and disclaimer of
          warranties, and Section 10 [Limitation of liability; indemnification].</p>
        <h2>3 Taxes</h2>
        <p><strong>3.1</strong> RemotePort does not provide tax, legal or accounting advice to Users. Clients and
          Contractors are responsible for their own tax reporting and withholding, either on their own or on the other’s
          behalf, for taxes of any type, including employment and income related tax, or indirect taxes (such as VAT or
          GST) depending on the applicable tax laws in the jurisdiction where they are domiciled.  After reviewing the
          Contractor Agreement template, Users should consult your own tax, legal or accounting advisors, prior to
          performing any Contractor Services or submitting or paying an invoice.  RemotePort will in no way be liable to
          you or any third party (including but not limited to any taxation authority) for any losses or penalties,
          pecuniary or otherwise, arising from a User using the Services, regardless of how such claims arise.</p>
        <p>3.2   <strong>Tax FormGeneration.</strong> For US-based Clients and Contractors, RemotePort generates forms
          W9, W-8BEN and W-8BEN-E (“<strong>Forms</strong>”)to be dated and signed by the relevant Users. We do not
          guarantee that information on any Form is accurate or correct, or that Users have selected the appropriate
          Form for the type of tax return they submit. Users should verify the accuracy and completeness of the
          information on the forms before submitting them to another party or to any tax authority. </p>
        <h2>4 Disputes</h2>
        <p><strong>4.1</strong> <strong>Client and ContractorDisputes.</strong> RemotePort does not resolve or otherwise
          adjudicate disputes or between Contractors and Clients – including those related to the quality of Contractor
          Services, interpretation of any Contractor Agreement or related statements of work, the payment of Fees, or
          any other disputes that may arise. Users are solely responsible for addressing disputes amongst each other.
          Refunds and reversals of payments made through a Payment Service Provider are subject to the terms and
          conditions of your Payment Service Provider agreement. If a Client owes outstanding payments to a Contractor
          after completion of work, or if a Client is dissatisfied with the service provided by a Contractor, the Client
          or Contractor may initiate cancellation of the Contractor Agreement through RemotePass. Cancellation of a
          Contractor Agreement through RemotePort has no bearing whatsoever on the merits of a dispute, or the
          interpretation of the terms of, or legality of a Contractor Agreement. Users shall not initiate or request
          payment for Contractor Services related to or alter the status of a Contractor Agreement after such agreement
          has been cancelled.</p>
        <p><strong>4.3 Disputes with RemotePass</strong>.  If you have a dispute with RemotePort (a
          “<strong>Complaint</strong>”), you agree to contact RemotePort through our Customer Support team to attempt to
          resolve any such dispute amicably. If we cannot resolve the dispute through RemotePort support team, you agree
          to notify us of the Claim at Attn: Legal, 6 Liberty Square#290, Boston, MA 02109 US or by email <a
            href="mailto:support@remoteport.com">support@remoteport.com</a> (a “<strong>Notice</strong>”).You and
          RemotePort then will seek informal voluntary resolution of the Complaint. Any Notice must include pertinent
          account information, a brief description of the Complaint, and contact information, so that we may evaluate
          your Complaint and attempt to informally resolve the Complaint. Both you and RemotePort will have 60 days from
          the date of the receipt of the Notice to informally resolve the other party’s Complaint, which, if successful,
          will avoid the need for further action. </p>
        <p><strong>4.4 Arbitration; Waiver of Class Action.</strong> If we cannot resolve the dispute through the
          Complaint process described in section 4.3 above, you and we agree that any dispute arising out of or relating
          to these Terms or the RemotePort Site or Services, including, without limitation, federal and state statutory
          claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal
          theory, shall be resolved through binding arbitration, on an individual basis (the “<strong>Arbitration
            Agreement</strong>”). Subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to pursue your claim
          in your local small claims court rather than through arbitration so long as your matter remains in small
          claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis. Arbitration shall be
          conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association&#x27;s rules for arbitration of
          consumer-related disputes (accessible at <a
            href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer Rules.pdf">here</a>).</p>
        <p>This Arbitration Agreement includes, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the
          interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope,
          or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement. All such matters shall
          be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court or judge.</p>
        <p><strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S
            INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR
            REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY“CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN
            ONE PERSON&#x27;S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, BY AGREEING TO THESE
            TERMS, YOU AND RemotePort ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO ATRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A
            CLASS ACTION.</strong></p>
        <p>The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place by an arbitrator in
          the county or parish in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, telephonically, in the
          English language. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of. competent jurisdiction could award and
          the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. An arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon will not
          have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect. At your request, the arbitrator may provide for submitting
          and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. To the extent permitted by law, the prevailing party
          in any action or proceeding to enforce these Terms, any arbitration pursuant to these Terms, or any small
          claims action shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. </p>
